# Algorithms & Data Structures practice

This repository contains all of the sources I've been using to practice algorithms and data structures for interviews and competetive programming.

# ROADMAP

__REFERENCE__: I will be using [roadmap from the coding interview website](https://www.codinginterview.com/interview-roadmap) as a main reference for structurizing my learning plan.

__GOAL__: Finish the roadmap until 3 months.

### What Programming language should I use

I've selected C++ for algorithms & data structures. Its swiftness is the main reason, but the vast amount of utilities from STL is a huge advantage as well.
