# Algorithms & Data Structures practice

This repository contains all of the sources I've been using to practice algorithms and data structures.

# What interesting I can find there?

There is a list of the most interesting mini-projects which you can find in this repository :nerd_face:

- [(C++) OOP bounded Knapsack Problem solver with auto-generated inputs](playground/dynamic_programming/bounded_knapsack)

- [(Python) LeetCode top 100 problems fetcher with auto-maintainable todo list written with Selenium](leetcode_top100/task_generator)

- [(C++) Shortest path to escape the dungeon with obstacles visualization](other_online_judge_tasks/dungeon_master_2d)
