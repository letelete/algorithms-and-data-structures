# Algorithms & Data Structures practice

This repository contains all of the sources I've been using to practice algorithms and data structures for interviews and competetive programming.



# ROADMAP

__REFERENCE__: I will be using (the roadmap of coding interview website)[https://www.codinginterview.com/interview-roadmap] as a main reference for structurizing my learning plan.

__GOAL__: Finish the roadmap in no more than 3 months.

### What Programming language should I use

I've selected C++ for algorithms & data structures. Its swiftness is the main reason, but the vast amount of utilities from STL is a huge advantage as well.

### Data Structures
- [x] BigO notation
- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] LinkedList
  - [x] Implementation
  - [x] Nth node
  - [x] Finding the middle element using two pointers
  - [x] Returning value of the node at given index
  - [x] Deleting list
  - [x] Detecing cycle using two pointers
  - [x] Detecing cycle and the cycle head node using *Floyd's cycle-finding* algorithm
  - [x] Removing nodes from the end and appending them on the front
  - [x] Reversing linked list in O(n) time and O(1) space
  - [x] Deleting repeated elements in O(n) time
  - [ ] Merge two unsorted linked list in efficient way
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Tries
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Sorting
- [ ] Searching
