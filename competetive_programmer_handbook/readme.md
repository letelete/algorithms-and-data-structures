# [Competetive Programmer's Handbook](https://github.com/pllk/cphb/blob/master/book.pdf)

This directory contains all files related to my studies of the "Competetive Programmer's Handbook" book. The book created by Antti Laaksonen is a great introductionary into the basics as well as advanced topics useful on competetive programming contests such as [IOI](https://ioinformatics.org/), or [Potyczki Algorytmiczne](https://potyczki.mimuw.edu.pl/) :wink:
