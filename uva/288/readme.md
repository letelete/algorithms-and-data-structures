# [352 - The Seasonal War](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&page=show_problem&problem=288)

# My approach

### O(n^2)

Depending on task's constraints the War Eagle is a distinct rectangle on given two-dimensional array, where each occurence of "1" is wrapped around with "0".

In the best-case scenerio the given rectangle will look as following:

```
000
010
000
```

Eventually we can stumble upon another "1" on the border of our actual "1". Then with help of backtracking, we can perform another "perfect-rectangle" operation when we ignore already seen "1"s and repeat the process until all of surroundings won't be visited/equal to "0".

# Task

```
The inhabitants of Tigerville and Elephantville are engaged in a seasonal war. Last month, Elephantville
successfully launched and orbited a spy telescope called the Bumble Scope. The purpose of the Bumble
Scope was to count the number of War Eagles in Tigerville. The Bumble Scope, however, developed two
problems because of poor quality control during its construction. Its primary lens was contaminated
with bugs which block part of each image, and its focusing mechanism malfunctioned so that images
vary in size and sharpness.
The computer programmers, who must rectify the Bumble Scope’s problems are being held hostage
in a Programming Contest Hotel in Alaland by elephants dressed like tigers. The Bumble Scope’s
flawed images are stored by pixel in a file called Bumble.in. Each image is square and each pixel or
cell contains either a 0 or a 1. The unique Bumble Scope Camera (BSC) records at each pixel location
a 1 if part or all of a war eagle is present and a 0 if any other object, including a bug, is visible. The
programmers must assume the following:
a) A war eagle is represented by at least a single binary one.
b) Cells with adjacent sides on common vertices, which contain binary ones, comprise one war eagle.
A very large image of one war eagle might contain all ones.
c) Distinct war eagles do not touch one another. This assumption is probably flawed, but the
programmers are desperate.
d) There is no wrap-around. Pixels on the bottom are not adjacent to the top and the left is not
adjacent to the right (unless, of course, there are only 2 rows or 2 columns)
```

### Input and Output

```
Write a program that reads images of pixels from the input file (a text file), correctly counts the number
of war eagles in the images and prints the image number and war eagle count for that image on a single
line in the output file (also a text file).
Use the format in the sample output. Do this for each image in the input file. Each image will be
preceded by a number indicating its square dimension. No dimension will exceed 25.
